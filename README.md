Overall a fun project. Taught me the K.I.S.S principle where you keep it simple stupid. This made sure that I 

Analysis copy:
Some things that can be suggested is that charter school have a higher overall passing rate than district schools. This is interesting because charter schools actually have less of a budget than district schools. Small to medium sized schools on average have a higher overall passing rate than large schools which makes sense. The cool thing is that medium sized schools have a higher passing rate overall. Probably because of the right amount of students to not be sooo close knit like some other smaller schools. An interesting thing is that the top 5 schools are charter and the bottom 5 are district schools. Now whether we can have concrete conclusions is a different thing. There are many reasons as to why a school with higher budget could be doing worse than those with less that aren't measured from the data we have. There are many confounding variables such as the quality of life a lot of these students have. District schools also have more of a budget because they probably have more personel to handle the larger quantity of crotch goblins(children). There is no true _causation_ that we can conclude but only decent ideas. Corellation never means causation.
